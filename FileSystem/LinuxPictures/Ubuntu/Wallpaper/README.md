# Ubuntu wallpaper collection

Ubuntu wallpapers are a resource Tuxbot can store for you, along with other Linux wallpapers. Due to copyright and size reasons, the wallpapers can't be included by default, so for now, you will need to supply your own for TuxBot.

## Future proofing

If Ubuntu is still going with the current naming convention in 2100, or is still going at all, what is going to be the 3rd digit? Will everything have to be renamed? (example: `04-10` becomes `004-10`) no, it will just continue as 100.04, or whatever the release is titled.
